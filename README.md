# Dog-Breed-Classification
Dog Breed Classification using CNN

# Project Overview

In this project, I build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can identify whether the given image is either a dog or a human or none. If detected dog, then code will identify the dog breed. Otherwise, if detected human, then the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

The code is written in Python 3 and Keras with Tensorflow backend all presented in Jupyter Notebook.
